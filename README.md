**Feel free to contribute!**

This project is open source. Let's share fantastic poems with as many people as possible!

**What I learned building this app**

_Core Data, Result, @escaping, debouncing searches, Share Sheets, ContextMenu, MVVM(with Combine), tracking app state using enums, tracking errors with enums, UIViewRepresentable, UserNotifications, filter, Tab Bars, NavigationViews _ <br>
It was really fun to dive into the deep end and try out building an app by myself. I'd like to thank 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson that fueled me with the necessary knowledge to complete this application. If you are learning Swift, be sure to check out his courses.
