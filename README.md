# Poetic

Poetic is a classic poetry reader. Enjoy thousands of poems from the greatest English poets. 

This app was built so that I would be able to read poetry more often, but also to aid my learning iOS development. 
See below for what was learned through creating this app.

**Features:**

- Search through thousands of classic English poems by author or by title.

- Save favorite poems and share them with friends.

- Long press your favorite quotes to highlight them or share them with friends. 

- Every time you boot up the app you will be shown a random poem from the API. If you don't dig it, swipe and release to receive a new random one.

This project is open source. Let's share fantastic poems with as many people as possible!

**What I learned building this app**

_Core Data, Result, @escaping, debouncing searches, Share Sheets, ContextMenu, MVVM, tracking app state using enums, tracking errors with enums, UIViewRepresentable, UserNotifications, filter _ <br>
It was really fun to dive into the deep end and try out building an app by myself. I'd like to thank 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson that fueled me with the necessary knowledge to complete this application. If you are learning Swift, be sure to check out his courses.
