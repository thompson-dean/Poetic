# Poetic

Poetic is a classic poetry reader. Enjoy thousands of poems from the greatest English poets. 

This app was built so I would be able to read poetry more frequently, but also to aid my iOS development learning. 
See below for what was learned through creating this app.

**Features:**

- Search through thousands of classic English poetry by author or by title.

- Save favorite poems into your favorites.

- Save favorite quotes by long pressing them. Also share your quotes with your friends in the quotes tab.

- Every time you boot up the app you will be shown a random poem from the API. If you don't dig it, swipe and release to receive a new random one.

**Feel free to contribute!**

This project is open source. Let's share fantastic poems with as many people as possible!

**What I learned building this app**
_Core Data, Result, @escaping, debouncing searches, Share Sheets, ContextMenu, MVVM, tracking app state using enums, tracking errors with enums, UIViewRepresentable_
It was really fun to dive into the deep end and try out building an app by myself. I'd like to thank 100 Days of SwiftUI by PaulHudson that fueled me with the necessary knowledge to complete this application.
